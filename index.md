I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028 or less.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3 Part-1

  For this lab, which focused on calculating the unit price of a pizza based on its diameter and price, I found it to be a particularly engaging exercise. It effectively demonstrated the practical application of mathematical concepts within programming. I appreciated how it challenged me to think critically about problem-solving and how to translate a real-world scenario into a computational algorithm, reinforcing my understanding of functions and user interaction in C++.

* Lab 8 Part-1

  This lab centered around a Mad Libs-style game for generating sandwich orders, was enjoyable due to its creative aspect. It was an excellent practice in manipulating strings and managing user input, but more importantly, it showed me the importance of input validation in software development. I learned that anticipating and handling unexpected user behavior is crucial for creating robust and user-friendly applications.

* Lab 11 part-2

  In the Hi-Lo game lab, I honed my skills in using control structures and managing user input in C++. I found it valuable for developing problem-solving abilities, as I had to set up a game loop and provide feedback based on user guesses. This lab was particularly memorable because it allowed me to handle game states and conditional logic, laying a solid foundation for more advanced programming tasks through the creation of an engaging command-line game.
